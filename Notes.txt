WIP
- Basic GUI

ToDo
- Compare 1080p, 720p, 480p and 360p in time vs space vs accuracy

- Add watermark (choose which corner)
-- Movie name (year)
-- blgraf (OR Benschii)
--- In a perfect world make that customisable in the GUI

- Batch/queue analysis

- More analysis methods (like the Median)
-- Median
-- Difference between animation and life action
--- animation tends to be more colourful, more contrasty
--- maybe brighten up life action colours by a certain percentage to make it look nicer

- Add option to create the image for X analysis (e.g. *only* bucket, or *only* average, or bucket *and* most frequent)

- Add resize feature directly to the GUI

Dreams
- Detect backgrounds and weigh those less
